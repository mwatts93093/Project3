/* All code in this source is my own. Primary source for code reference was Microsoft.learn.
* This code was based off of Dr. Qin's code. It is not the same but I did start from there.
* I did not copy/paste code directly from Phind AI but I did have it educate me and assist in solving my issues.
* COMP7500: Project 3: Aubatch
* Tucker Watts
* Auburn University
*
* This source code shows how to evaluate metrics related to job scheduling methods.
* 
* Compile with makefile using:
* make
*
* Can be run using "./aubatch" and referring to the help command.
